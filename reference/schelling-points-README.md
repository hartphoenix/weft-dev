# Schelling Points

A Jackbox TV-like mobile word game. Given a category (e.g. cities, animals, types of vehicles), all players privately submit the item they think everyone else will pick. When all answers are in, results are revealed with scores based on semantic clustering.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` is protected — all changes via PR with 1 required review
- Create feature branches for your work (e.g. `feature/lobby-ui`, `feature/embedding-pipeline`)
- PRs merge into `main`

## Timeline

| Day | Goal |
|-----|------|
| Tue | PRD finalized, API contract agreed, architecture locked, repos scaffolded |
| Wed | Core game loop — category, input, scoring, results (single-player) |
| Thu | Multiplayer — room/lobby, game state machine, real-time sync |
| Fri | Integration, playtesting, polish, edge cases |
| Sat | Deploy + demo |
